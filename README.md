# Introduction
This is **NOT A GAME.** This is a Minecraft mod that needs a purposed design in order to deliver to the players the desired, targeted experience.

This is a **Fabric Mod for Minecraft 1.21 and Above.** Backports are not currently considered as of the current moment, but will probably exist in the future.

**Lost In The Complex** is heavily inspired by **The Backrooms** and **Liminal Spaces**, as well as Backrooms Minecraft mods such as [LudoCrypt](https://ludocrypt.crd.co)'s magnificently designed [The Corners](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-corners) mod and [Lumaa](https://lumaa.gitbook.io/backrooms)'s [The Backrooms](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms) mod. Their work is extraordinary and they put a lot of effort into it, so please go check them out.

**Unlike the currently existing Backrooms-themed/Liminal-spaced-themed mods**, this mod aims to deliver a similar aesthetic experience and a completely diverse gameplay experience.

# General Gameplay
You will be spawning into the Backrooms directly - Yes, your odds are *that* bad. You will also encounter many different entities that'll probably chase you and make you their dinner for another day (If there is a day in the Backrooms, of course) in the large complex. Dangerous sections of the complex could also kill you by giving you effects that can't be dismissed with almond water, or any other... hazardous effects.

On the plus side (and there is one, hopefully by the time this mod reaches its release), supplies are existent in the Backrooms. Some unfortunate player probably left that their before, or even more unfortunate, it's their remains... that or the cruel place has 'decided' to give you some breathing time.

Other than that, everything is up to you - exploring the dangerous complex, looting everything you can ever find in this place, allying and befriend every player you meet or kill anyone you had landed a glimpse on, build bases as temporary safe havens for players to rest, raid bases and leave players to their demise, noclipping into different levels for exploration, or noclipping through the levels to speedrun for your own entertainment...... **Everything is up to you.**

> Rumors say that there's probably a level that leads to an exit to the Backrooms. Maybe that's just someone's prayers or illusional talk before dying in this place. But who knows for exact? Maybe you'll find one...
